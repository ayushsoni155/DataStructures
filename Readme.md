## How to use
1. Open a category folder.
2. Each problem has a README or solution file named: ProblemName.md / ProblemName.(cpp|py|java).
3. Each solution includes: problem link, approach, code, time & space complexity, and notes.

## Core problem checklist (examples)
- Arrays
    - Two Sum, Subarray Sum, Merge Intervals, Dutch National Flag
- Strings
    - Longest Palindromic Substring, Anagram Check, KMP pattern match, Sliding Window problems
- Linked Lists
